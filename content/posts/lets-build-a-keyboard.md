I've been pretty interested in mechanical keyboards lately.  Building one has been on my bucket
list for awhile now so last weekend I decided to check out [Yusha Kobo](https://yushakobo.jp/), a
specialty keyboard store based in Tokyo which sells kits.

I purchased my first build kit the
[Mint60](https://eucalyn.shop/shop/kits/mint60-starter) which a split keyboard. The 60 standing for the 60%
keyboard layout which is a popular form factor for hobby keyboards.

My Mint60 build kit comes with the following:

* A transparent keyboard casing
* Screws (spacer x20, 5mm x 28, 8mm x 12)
* CherryPCB Stablisers x5
* ProMicro Arduino x2
* TRRS Audio Jack x2
* RGB LED Strip
* Reset Switch x2
* And a lot of resistors

Note, build kits sold at Yusha Kobo (and most online stores) **don't include key
switches or key caps**. These have to be purchased seperately with your kit. The
Mint60 has 66 keys so I needed to purchase 66 switches and the key caps
seperately.

### What do I need to put a kit together?

* A keyboard starter kit (includes a pcb, mirocontroller, keyboard stablizers,
  case, etc.)
* Your own keyboard switches and caps (If not included in your kit)
* Soldering gear (solder, soldering iron, copper wick)
* A pair for small wire cutters
* A multi-meter for debugging (optional)
* A lot of patience

Note, you probably won't need a multi-meter but it may help if you made
mistakes soldering. I ended up using a multi-meter to test my switches and some
components for [continuity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOK8np4t40c).

### Key switches

One of the most rewarding parts of building your own keyboard is selecting your
own key switches. Here's a great [YouTube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbPCqVsX-wQ) for finding the right switch
for you.

In the end I chose Cherry MX red switches (80 for around 3000 JPY) at
Yusha Kobo. These are soft to press and don't make much noise.

### Keyboard caps

For this build I chose [Tai-Hao PBT
Hawaii](https://yushakobo.jp/shop/tai-hao-pbt-hawaii/) keycap set which I bought
at Yusha Kobo.

### Before you get started

\* **Solder your microcontroller LAST!** \*

If you're stupid like me you might solder your microcontroller on before your
key switches. Don't be stupid like me.

Once you solder on the microcontroller **you can no longer solder any key
switches above it**.  This may not be true for most kits but this was the case
for the Mint60 kit I bought ðŸ¤¦

\* **Make sure your switches are soldered in completely** \*

When I put everything together and plugged the keyboard in I noticed some keys
didn't work. Taking a closer look you can see a small gap in the pin hole which
holds the key switch.

When soldering you should always make sure to cover pin holes completely
in solder otherwise they can spring loose which is what happened here.

When soldering you want to make sure you cover each pin hole completely in
solder and have a nice cone shape like the pin on the right in the above photo.

### Getting started

The first thing is soldering in **resistors**.  If your PCB does not have these
soldered in already you will have to manually do this. Resistors are needed to
prevent voltage from fluctuating and randomly triggering key
presses. More on why resitors are needed [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/button).

I pain-stakingly bent each individual resistor to fit it into the board. 
A quick trick that will save you time is to find a book or edge and bend all the
resistors at the same time. This will ensure you can quickly slide all the
resisters into the pin holes on your board.

Once you slide in the resistors into the board, bend the bottoms so they don't fall
out

Afterwards solder the pin hole down and cut off the excess legging with wire
cutters

### Soldering on the key switches

Your kit should come with a plate where you can start mounting your switches to
your board.

**Be careful at this step**. Once you've decided on a layout you won't be able
to easily de-solder the key switches again. It's possible, but will suck.

*Note, the black areas surrounding the larger keys are called [stablisers](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Stabiliser). These ensure longer keys
like spacebar or backspace don't fly off when pressed on the side. These
are held in place through small holes in the PCB. At least, this was the case on
my board.*

Once you have decided on your choice of layout and swtiches you can start
soldering the key switches onto the board. Also make sure the small white circle
on the back of your key switch is flush against the backside of the PCB. I
recommend using small clamps to hold the board in place before soldering.

### Flash your microcontroller

Your kit should come with a microcontroller. The most popular microcontroller for keyboards
looks like the [Arduino Pro Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640).  

I went a bit crazy when I built my first kit. I had soldered
everything onto the board and plugged it in. Nothing. Keys were not registered.
No LED lights. This is because **most kits dont flash the microcontroller**. You will need to flash the
firmware onto the microcontroller otherwise nothing will work.

I used [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) for flashing my microcontroller. This is a free open source
project for hardware keyboards. Flashing the microcontroller is easy using QMK. You just
plug it into USB and run the QMK software and select your keyboard model.
Most hobby boards have their software already included in the [QMK
repository](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) so flashing is easy.

### Soldering on the remaining components

After you made sure your microcontroller can be flashed its time to solder the
rest of the components down. For me, this meant the TRRS audio jack for my split
keyboard, a microcontroller, and a small RGB LED strip

### Make sure your key switches work

Once your microcontroller has been flashed and soldered you can start testing each key
switch. This is good idea before closing the keyboard up. If one key does not respond
it may need to be resoldered. I had several switches which needed to be resoldered on
my first build because I didn't use enough solder.

After that you need some software for testing. If you are on OSX I recommend using [Karabiner
EventViewer](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/). Once installed you can check each
individual key and make sure it maps to the correct key. A word of warning though the "fn"
key will not register unless you press it in combination with another key.

### Put on your key caps!

Almost there! Once you've verified your board works you can start putting the
key caps on it!

### Customization keymaps

After you get your board setup you will want to start customizing the layout a
bit. This is pretty simple once you can get QMK compiling locally. After you can
compile the project you can simply modify the keymap inside QMK. I ended up modifying my [original keymap](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/mint60/keymaps/default/keymap.c)
with my own mappings.

I would defintely recommend reading the noob guide to QMK before jumping in to
get an idea of the full set of features:
[https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/newbs/newbs_getting_started](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/newbs/newbs_getting_started)

### Conclusion

It turns out building a mechanical keyboard is actually not that difficult.
I had a difficult time because I didn't read my kits instructions and I
paid for it with hours of de-soldering...

In the end, a keyboard is just a bunch of switches. The circuit is quite simple
and easy to understand. It's essentially a bunch of [arduino
buttons](https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/button) rigged together if
you've every done anything with the Arduino it should be quite simple.

Eventually I want to design my own PCB layout. However, for the time
being I'm quite happy with form factors most hobby kits offer :)
